I am Parth Kothari, a second year PhD working at the Visual Intelligence for Transport ([VITA](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/vita/)) lab at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). I work under the supervision of Prof. Alexandre Alahi, broadly in the field of understanding human motion behavior, with focus on social forecasting in autonomous vehicles. I got my undergraduate degree in Electrical Enginerring from ([IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in)).
