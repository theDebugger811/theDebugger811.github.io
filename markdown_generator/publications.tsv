2019-10-01	Adversarial Loss in Human Trajectory Prediction	European Association for Research in Transportation (hEART)	Highlighted an unexpected pitfall in the state-of-the-art architecture for multimodal human prediction via controlled experiments. Proposed a modification to the architecture leveraging the progress in the GAN community. Demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed modification on real world datasets, indicating room for improvement on state-of-the-art.	Parth Kothari, Alexandre Alahi. (2009).
